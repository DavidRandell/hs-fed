# Submission Notes 

Hi HubDev's, what a great tech test this is... i mean was! A challenging one I must say. I got through as much as I could. I am dissapointed in myself for not getting all the filtering hooked up. It's an Angular issue and I couldn't resolve some of it. Same with the clear filters, frustrating that I ran out of time to hook that bit of functionality up as well. 

Hey, I did get the Seach filter working! (Yes...I know, the icon isn't in there. If only I was allowed to add the <i> tag to the HTML! Grrr. I had to prioritise functionality over bling!

## Given more time, what would you have done differently?

Less bling, more function!

Probably taken your advice and used this as a chance to try React, ES6 and Webpack! I love trying and getting to know new tech, thing is sometimes that can be spreading yourself a bit thin, I should probably focus on becoming better at one JS framework and stick to that. In this case I had to use Angular as it's the one I have the most experience with.

I might have tried Lodash, as that would have made the filtering of the nested Arrays and functionality a bit faster i suppose.

## Is there anything else you'd like to let us know?

I want to say I really appreciate your patience while I worked on this. It was tough finding good chunks of time to dedicate to it but that's no excuse. 

Frankness time...  I found this test to be quite challenging in parts. I had to do a good bit of Googling (which is an artform in itself in this business!) to get through some of it. My favorite part of Front End and what I consider my strength is CSS. A good percentage of my past experience was embedded on Marketing and Advertising teams so my role was mostly the HTML/CSS build of Microsites and Email assets so their wasn't always much JS involved and when there was I stuck to jQuery. I could have used mostly jQuery for this but I really wanted to test myself and forced myself to use a Framework. Risky but the right thing to do, even if some stuff didn't get completed.

I would really relish the opportunity to develop and grow as a Hubspotter. I would be 150% commited to getting back up to speed on whatever framework is called for, while I contribute in areas I am strong at. What I love about the company is the attitude, culture and the team first mentality. 

If things don't work out this time I hope I can take another shot someday when I build up a bit more experience with JS.

Thanks again for this awesome experience!
